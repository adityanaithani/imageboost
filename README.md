# Imageboost

This was a tiny project I threw together as a bit of a joke in second year of college after I took a class where we did an image processing project.

I messed up one of the functions and found out I just made a really bad deep-fryer, which was already an outdated meme when I made this. Turns out I had to do a lot of work (read: completely rewrite the function) to get it to work outside of the _proprietary version of javascript_ (why?) we were using for the class,

I have not touched this since then but I found it in a folder somewhere when cleaning out my laptop and thought I might as well throw it onto GitHub lol.

(I spent a while reading through the wikipedia for [saturation arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_arithmetic#:~:text=Saturation%20arithmetic%20is%20a%20version,a%20minimum%20and%20maximum%20value.) just before I posted this and wow there's so much more I could have done with this project - maybe I'll come back to it someday, the topic is pretty interesting.)
